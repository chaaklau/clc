3. The system of error codes
Learner errors are tagged using the following convention:
<#CODE>wrong word|corrected word</#CODE>
The majority of the error codes are based on a two-letter coding system in which the first letter represents
the general type of error (e.g. wrong form, omission), while the second letter identifies the word class of
the required word.
General types of error (first letter)
F wrong Form used
M something Missing
R word or phrase needs Replacing
U word or phrase is Unnecessary (i.e. redundant)
D word is wrongly Derived
The codes M, R, and U can occur alone where no more specific information can be given.
Word classes (second letter)
A Pronoun (Anaphoric)
C Conjunction (linking word)
D Determiner
J AdJective
N Noun
Q Quantifier
T Preposition
V Verb (includes modals)
Y Adverb (-lY)
Punctuation errors (Error type + P)
Punctuation errors are coded with P as the second letter, and one of the error types M, R, U as the first
letter.
MP punctuation Missing
RP punctuation needs Replacing
UP Unnecessary punctuation
When punctuation errors are corrected by the coder, any change in capitalization is also shown within the
error coding. For example, the sentence *He died we buried him the next day omits a full stop after he died
and therefore requires the <#MP>|.</#MP> coding. However, the new sentence break requires the w of we
to be capitalized. This is shown by the coding He died <#MP>we|.We</#MP> buried him the next day. This
covers both the punctuation error and the required changes to the capitalization.
Countability errors (C + word class)
CN countability of Noun error
CQ wrong Quantifier because of noun countability
CD wrong Determiner because of noun countability
CN means that the student has used a form which is not available in the intended sense of the noun (e.g.
*the country’s natural beauties, *two transports). Where a noun could be either count or uncount but the
wrong form has been used, the error is FN, wrong form of noun (e.g. vacation/vacations).
False friend errors (FF + any word class)
All false friend errors are tagged with FF. The word class of the required word is specified by adding a
word class code (A, C, D, J, N, Q, T, V, Y) to the FF code. This code is only used when the coder is certain
he/she is dealing with a documented False Friend. Otherwise, it is treated as a replace (R) error.
Agreement errors (AG + word class)
AGA Anaphoric (pronoun) agreement error
AGD Determiner agreement error
AGN Noun agreement error
AGV Verb agreement error

Additional error codes
AS incorrect Argument Structure
CE Compound Error
CL CoLlocation error
ID IDiom error
IN Incorrect formation of Noun plural
IV Incorrect Verb inflection
L inappropriate register (Label)
S Spelling error
SA American Spelling
SX Spelling confusion error
TV wrong Tense of Verb
W incorrect Word order
X incorrect formation of negative
AS (argument structure error) covers errors in argument structures which cannot be coded as MT (missing
preposition, e.g. *he explained me) or UT (unnecessary preposition, e.g. *he told to me). AS is particularly
used for double object verbs, e.g. *it caused trouble to me is coded <#AS>it caused trouble to me|it caused
me trouble</#AS> to circumvent the need for multiple codes to correct what is, in fact, a single error.
CE (complex error) is a catch-all code to cover multiple errors and groups of words the intended sense of
which cannot be established. By using this code, we factor out of the equation strings which can yield little
useful information on learner errors.
SA (American Spelling) is not a true error code since it is not always possible to know whether a learner
has made a mistake or is deliberately using US spelling, but was introduced in view of the fact that learners
are usually very clear about which variety of English they wish to learn and ELT and dictionary publishers
still need to highlight the differences between the varieties of English in their products. The SX code
(spelling confusion error) covers spelling confusables such as to/too, their/there and weather/whether. It is
possible to override the distinctions made by these codes by searching on the general-spelling group code
<#SPELL>.
4. Some practical issues
4.1. Avoiding over-coding and 'creating' errors
We are not attempting to rewrite the scripts into perfect English or to interpret the text. Often, things could
be expressed better by paraphrase - this is not our task. We are only correcting and documenting errors.
Equally, the coder must resist the temptation to make moral judgements about a student's intended
meaning. If the language used is 'correct', the idea behind it is not brought into question.
4.2. Embedding errors
In cases where a word is both wrongly spelled and the wrong word, for example, one code can be
embedded within another.
e.g. I like to <#S>hospitelize|hospitalise</#S> my relatives - the student means ‘put them up’ or ‘have them
to stay’ (show them hospitality). This should be an <#RV> error, not a spelling error and the spelling
correction should be embedded inside the more significant RV code. Thus:
<#RV><#S>hospitelize|hospitalise</#S>|put up</#RV>.
4.3. Choosing error codes in ambiguous cases
Coders are occasionally faced with a decision between two different codes. This is the case in, for example:
*He said me that ... The coder must decide whether to correct this by replacing the verb (RV) with a
synonym (told) which works in the given argument structure (He told me that), or to add the missing
preposition (MT) to make the argument structure of the student’s chosen verb correct (He said to me that).
We want to keep as close as possible to the student’s original text, so it is helpful to think of the
error codes as having a loose hierarchy. In this case, changing a verb’s argument structure is a less severe
change than changing the verb itself and puts right what the student said wrongly, rather than starting again
from scratch. So, ‘He said <#MT>|to</#MT> me that’ is more helpful, than, ‘He <#RV>said|told</#RV>
me that’. It is more helpful to teach students to use a verb correctly than to teach them to avoid using a verb
which they use incorrectly. Similarly, where it is impossible to know what the student intended in a
Replace error, no correct version is inserted, as a coder’s ‘wild guess’ can be of little help and will distort
the data.
